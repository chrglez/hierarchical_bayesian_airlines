This evolution , driven by Web 2.0 technologies,  has given rise to online review platforms featuring user-generated content (UGC), providing valuable insights for prospective customers and fundamentally reshaping customer engagement with businesses. Thus, online consumer reviews (OCRs) have begun to significantly influence consumer decision-making processes [@mendes-filho2018a], shaping brand image [@lam2020a] , and enhancing electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) [@muda2021a;@nusairat2021a]. Furthermore, within the academic field, scholars are increasingly recognizing the advantages of applying UGC due to its accessibility and capacity for in-depth analysis. Consequently, there has been a notable growth in scholarly research incorporating UGC.\n\nGiven the unique characteristics of airline services, both in-flight and on-ground, effective customer communication and feedback are indicators of the operational efficiency and overall customer experience. Existing literature on airline services heavily relies on surveys as the primary data source to explore perceptions of service quality and customer satisfaction. The recent increasing integration of online reviews into scholarly research is attributed to accessibility, diverse perspectives, and rich data content, thereby overcoming the sampling limitations associated with traditional surveys. The incorporation of UGC within the airline industry has been widely utilized for various research aims, such as assessing passengers' emotions following flight delays [@song2020a], investigating the impact of airline alliance strategy on service quality [@migdadi2022a], and predicting airline recommendations. [@jain2022a;@siering2018a]. However, despite the growing literature utilizing custom-shared experiences, there remains a gap in understanding the variability in online customer ratings within the airline industry. To address this gap, this study proposes a Bayesian approach for measuring and managing score heterogeneity across major online review platforms.\n\n**(Methodogy/Need to check)** Recently, [@martel2023a] noted a lack of research on the application of Bayesian techniques in publications within the tourism and hospitality sectors, particularly in studies focused on eWOM. While Bayesian approaches have found extensive adoption across various fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing over the past decades, their application in hospitality research remains limited. Despite numerous advantages, including the incorporation of prior data, flexibility, and the ability to handle small sample sizes, the integration of Bayesian methods in hospitality studies remains constrained. According to @bianchi2021a Bayesian statistics provide a more nuanced analysis compared to classical methods, which is particularly beneficial for the hospitality sector. Through the analysis of data obtained from primary OCR platforms for airlines, namely TripAdvisor and Skytrax, the study presents a novel Bayesian approach to understanding score heterogeneity among the principal review portals for airlines.\n\nThe airline industry has experienced notable transformations following the introduction of Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs), which have impacted passengers' perceptions and shaped distinct expectations according to airline's business model. The evaluation of services provided by LCCs differ compared to Full-Service Carriers (FSCs) due to disparities in airfare pricing  and customer anticipations. This distinction is underscored by the customer satisfaction coefficient, revealing the heightened importance of different attributes [@byun2016a]. Thus, to conduct a comprehensive analysis, both LCCs and FSCs will be examined.\n\nGiven research presents the methodology and findings of Bayesian analysis, based on data collected from leading online review platforms for both LCCs and FSCs. Through in-depth approach, the study not only contributes to the existing literature on UGC and airline service quality but also brings attention to rating heterogeneity, offering a comprehensive understanding of score variations. These insights are valuable for theoretical scholars utilizing UGC for their analysis, as the majority of studies tend to concentrate on a single UGC platform, while also holding practical implications for stakeholders seeking to enhance service quality, foster eWOM, and manage brand image effectively within the highly competitive industry.\n\n## Literature Review {#sec-lit-review}\n\n### The importance of online consumer reviews in tourism.\n\nOnline reviews have captured considerable attention of both academia and industry due to their significant impact on consumer behavior and purchasing decisions. Thus, UGC has become increasingly essential in the tourism sector, particularly considering the intangible nature of hospitality and the growing reliance on reviews for travel planning. Notably, such content is considered more credible than official sites and tourist destination pages [@bilos2022a], influences travelers’ behavior more than marketing-generated-content [@tsiakali2018a], and positively influences tourists' intentions to book a hotel and visit a destination [@ukpabi2018a]. Research by @cox2009a in the accommodation sector reveals that the majority of consumers prioritize the views of other travelers over the hotel's self-description available online. Furthermore, UGC has more credibility and trustworthiness compared to professionally generated content, and this trustworthiness remains consistent regardless of whether participants encounter positive or negative information [@cheong2008a].\n\nAccording to @muritala2020a, the research on online reviews and electronic eWOM in tourism and hospitality is reaching a mature stage, characterized by a rapidly growing volume of studies built on a solid base of seminal research and the application of the latest analytical techniques, including artificial neural networks and deep learning. Academics have extensively studied UGC in relation to travel planning behaviour [@bilos2022a; @cox2009a; @mendes-filho2018a; @tsiakali2018a], corporate reputation management [@baka2016a; @nicoli2017a], motivations for content contribution [@bronner2011a; @daugherty2008a; @kaur2021a; @yoo2009a], credibility perception [@cheong2008a; @filieri2021a; @lo2019a],  helpfulness determinants [@filieri2021a; @hu2020a; @huang2015a; @kwon2021a; @lo2019a], predicting recommendations [@jain2022a; @siering2018a], and service recovery [@etemad-sajadi2019a; @xu2019a].\n\nThe increasing adoption of OCRs in scholarly research is attributed to numerous advantages. Firstly, it provides direct access to extensive datasets with organically generated and diverse data. In certain instances, OCRs enable researchers to gather socio-demographic details of content contributors, supporting cross-cultural studies and analyses of age or gender disparities [@dike2024a; @punel2019a; @stamolampros2019a; @sudhakar2020a]. **(DO I NEED TO PUT ARTICLES?)**.  Additionally, given the unique nature of airline services, reviews often contain valuable information on cabin class, airline type, and routes for evaluating moderating effect and comparative analysis, along with additional ratings on certain service attributes for extended examination [@lucini2020a; @sezgen2019a; @tahanisaz2020a]. Furthermore, reviews allow researchers to track changes in customer perceptions, preferences, and behaviors in response to significant external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic [@hassan2022a; @nilashi2022a; @sulu2022a] and economic crises. However, study by @lu2015a underscores that the anonymity of UGC creators, sample representativeness and the generalizability of results poses challenges to research validity, thereby questioning the reliability of findings.\n\nAcknowledging the importance of online reviews, scholars have begun investigating their credibility and willingness to use. Research conducted by @lo2019a revealed higher perceived credibility scores among reviews that are negative , written by experts and with a consistent rating. Consumers seek the opinions of others to minimize risks and gather prepurchase information, making these opinions more valuable than advertising. According to @bilos2022a  respondents rely on UGC more than their friends' recommendations and promotional content. For analyzing the intention to use online consumer reviews, scholars rely on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [@davis1989a] as a predominant framework in hospitality literature, which identifies perceived usefulness and ease of use as key factors. In addition, @changchit2020a identified perceived credibility and importance of online reviews, along with computer self-efficacy, as additional factors influencing users' intentions. According to @mendes-filho2018a, there is a heightened intention to use UGC in travel planning if the content provides perceived empowerment and usefulness. The study by @assaker2020a found that gender and age significantly moderate travellers’ intention to use UGC, with perceived usefulness being more influential for male travellers and perceived ease of use being more impactful for female and older travellers.\n\nOnline travel review authors are primarily motivated by a desire to help service providers, concern for other consumers, and the need for enjoyment and positive self-enhancement [@yoo2009a]. @kaur2021a analysing motivations behind review submission, defined altruism, reciprocity, egocentric behavior, knowledge self-efficacy, and collectivism as a key antecedents. Identifying profile of vacationers contributing to review sites, @bronner2011a reveal them to typically be under 55 years, from high and lower-middle-income groups, and often couples with or without children. The authors highlighted the importance of distinguishing between self-directed and other-directed motivations, which influence the type of review site and the manner of expression. Self-directed motivations favor marketer-generated sites, commenting on fewer aspects, predominantly negative reviews, and contributing to less accessible platforms. Vacationers with other-directed motivations prefer consumer-generated sites, engaging in broader commenting, posting mainly positive reviews, using both text and ratings, and contributing to sites accessible to other vacationers. According to @wilson2012a, national attitudes and motivations significantly influence the type of UGC posted. In their study, authors found that British and Swiss users tend to share photos and videos on social media to relive vacation experiences, while Spanish users prefer using text and comments to make recommendations to other travelers.\n\nWith the widespread availability of online reviews and the consequent information overload, scholars have begun to study reviews in relation to their perceived helpfulness. However, despite extensive research into the determinants of review helpfulness within tourism and hospitality, findings remain mixed. A recent study by @hu2020a identified review length as the most influential factor, followed by reviewer expertise and age, while the impact of review valence and readability was found to be insignificant. Conversely, @filieri2018a contended that long reviews are not necessarily perceived as helpful. Instead, consumers favor fact-based, objective, and logically structured reviews especially in the context of  high involvement purchase decisions. According to @kwok2016a, the helpfulness of online hotel reviews is negatively affected by review length and rating, whereas positively impacted by manager response and reviewer experience. @huang2015a determined the relationship between word count and helpfulness remained significant for reviews containing 144 words or fewer. However, once the word count exceeded, the relationship loose statistical significance. Analysing extremely negative ratings, @filieri2019a, found that these ratings are often considered helpful and diagnostic, as they provide valuable insights to justify the extreme evaluation, thereby significantly contributing to consumer decision-making.\n\n### The research on OCR applied to airlines industry\n\nDespite the growing adoption of reviews in scholarly research, studies specifically addressing online reviews related to airlines remain limited. Analyzing service quality within tourism and hospitality industry using UGC, @lu2015a discovered that the majority of studies focused on the lodging setting, with relatively fewer investigations conducted in the airline, online travel agent, and restaurant settings. Similarly, an analysis of online customer evaluations in tourism and hospitality by @schuckert2015a revealed that over half of the reviewed articles concentrated on hotels. Existing research of airline service through online customer-shared experiences are primarily focused on perceptions of service quality [@brochado2023a; @korfiatis2019a; @rasool2021a], customer satisfaction [@ban2019a; @chatterjee2023a; @dike2024a; @lucini2020a], and behavioural intentions [@siering2018a; @wang2023a].\n\nConsumer feedback platforms have undergone a significant expansion, gaining increasing popularity with the advent of Web 2.0. Online reviews assessing airline services within the scholarly literature primarily rely on data sourced from Skytrax and TripAdvisor platforms,  with some studies also incorporating UGC sourced from social media, particularly Twitter. (DO I NEED TO ADD TWITTER ARTICLES). A study by @lu2023a underscores the importance of incorporating content from multiple review channels to gain a more accurate understanding of service quality, recognizing the potential disparities across platforms. The study on US airlines revealed that Skytrax reviewers prioritize boarding and baggage experiences, whereas Twitter users emphasize customer service interactions. @bilos2022a providing a comparative analysis with Airbnb, found that TripAdvisor reviews are perceived as more valuable for making purchasing decisions. Through conducting a comparative analysis between results sourced from Twitter and the Department of Transportation's official service quality report for US airlines, (Tian et al., 2020) **SEARCH REFERENCE** established the reliability of service quality metrics derived from social media.\n\nCross-cultural investigations in the field have uncovered differences in the evaluation of provided services, influenced by the cultural backgrounds of reviewers. @punel2019a revealed the influence of  passengers’ country of residence to travel experience, perception, and the evaluation of airline services. Notably, North American passengers prioritize cost over in-flight services and complain more about their national airlines, while East and Southeast Asian passengers are satisfied with Asian airlines and value in-flight services. Middle Easterners are critical of non-local airlines, while Oceania travelers expect high service standards and South Americans have lower expectations for in-flight amenities with an emphasis on price. According to Dike and Davis (2023) **SEARCH REFERENCE** passengers from individualistic cultural backgrounds tend to perceive service quality as lower compared to customers from collectivist cultural backgrounds. @stamolampros2019a found that airline passengers' satisfaction with service quality varies depending on their cultural values, impacting both overall satisfaction and specific aspects such as staff interactions, food quality, seat comfort, and cleanliness. Additionally, the study discovered that cultural characteristics significantly shape both numerical ratings and textual content in reviews.\n\nThe existing literature examining the airline industry underscores distinct disparities between Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs) and Full-Service Carriers (FSCs), emphasizing the significant impact of airline category on passenger expectations and perceptions of service quality. Consequently, each type of carrier should strategically prioritize specific features to enhance overall service delivery. According to @lim2020a, FSCs should focus on enhancing tangible features, while LCCs should concentrate on reliability. Furthermore, variations in recommendation drivers exist across different airline business models. (Siering et al., 2018) revealed that LCCs should focus on improving augmented service aspects like amenities to enhance recommendations, while FSNCs should prioritize core service aspects such as in-flight amenities and customer service quality.\n\n#### OCR studies based on data collected in Tripadvisor.\n\nTripadvisor, the world's largest travel guidance platform, features over 1 billion reviews and is accessible in 43 markets and 22 languages (Tripadvisor, 2024) **SEARCH REFERENCE**.  In addition to its general community guidelines, the platform has established specific posting guidelines for reviews, which are displayed on an organization’s listing page and are associated with a bubble rating ranging from 1 to 5. Beyond overall ratings, contributors evaluate  additional service attributes, including legroom, seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, onboard experience, customer service, value for money, cleanliness, check-in and boarding processes, as well as food and beverage quality. \n\nThe platform has been extensively utilized as a data source by various investigators worldwide, contributing to diverse research findings. In particular, online reviews serve as an efficient tool for examining customer satisfaction. @sudhakar2020a analyzed Indian airlines using TripAdvisor feedbacks to reveal varying factors influencing satisfaction across nationalities and airline types, with Indian passengers prioritizing value for money and foreign passengers prioritizing service attributes. @sezgen2019a examined 45 international airlines to define the key drivers of passenger satisfaction and dissatisfaction across full-service and low-cost carriers, as well as economy and premium cabins. Despite variations in satisfaction drivers, fundamental factors such as friendly staff, value, and service quality remain universally important. In the US airline market, @park2020a underscores the need for sustainable strategies beyond price competition, highlighting the asymmetric impact of service quality attributes on customer satisfaction and their critical importance in airline operations. According to @korfiatis2019a, integrating unstructured data from online reviews into service quality assessment enhances understanding and predictability of customer satisfaction. Examining Tripadvisor reviews, the study revealed temporal variations in dimensions, thereby emphasizing the importance of monitoring and adapting to changing customer preferences over time. \n\nAdditionally, Tripadvisor reviews have been used to identify key themes by @brochado2019a and @sulu2022a during the pandemic. The study by @brochado2019a was aimed to identify the main themes in traveler reviews and their relationship with value-for-money ratings by examining airlines affiliated with the largest alliances, SkyTeam and Star Alliance, across France, the United States, Indonesia, Canada, Taiwan, and Germany. Whereas,  Sulu’s [-@sulu2022a] research focused on online airline reviews during the COVID-19 outbreak, aiming to define principal themes and identify disparities among passengers of various nationalities. The analysis revealed that European passengers exhibited the most polarized opinions, ranging from highly critical to highly satisfied, while American and Australian passengers predominantly expressed positive reviews.\n\n#### OCR studies based on data collected in Skytrax.\n\nSkytrax is the international air transport rating organisation with Air Travel review forum (www.airlinequality.com) that has become a leading review site for airline, airport and associated air travel traveller reviews **SEARCH REFERENCE** (Skytrax, 2024). Reviews submitted to the platform undergo a multi-stage checking process to ensure compliance with the Editorial Policy   and requires reviewers to submit feedback that follows a structured evaluation framework. The platform enables passengers to share detailed opinions on their experiences across four categories: airline, seat, airport, and lounge. Passengers can rate airlines on a scale from 1 to 10 and provide textual comment, along with additional details such as country of residence, date of flight, route, cabin class, aircraft type, type of travel, and likelihood of recommending the airline. Moreover, contributors assess supplementary service attributes including value for money, ground service, seat comfort, cabin staff service, food & beverages, in-flight entertainment, and cabin Wi-Fi & connectivity.\n\nVarious scholars have used Skytrax reviews to define key factors influencing customer experience and satisfaction within the airline sector. @ban2019a identified six key clusters, including seat comfort, staff service, entertainment, ground service, value for money, and airline brand, with all factors except entertainment significantly impacting customer satisfaction and recommendation. Shadiyar et al. (2020) **SEARCH REFERENCE** explored the utilization of big data analytics and online customer reviews to enhance customer satisfaction in airlines, identifying factors such as seat comfort, staff behavior, food and beverage quality, ground service, and particularly value for money as main. The study by @lucini2020a was aimed to measure customer satisfaction by analyzing Skytrax reviews to provide airlines with guidelines to improve competitiveness. The study revealed that the type of cabin significantly impacts customer satisfaction dimensions, prioritizing customer service for first-class passengers, comfort for premium economy passengers, and efficient baggage handling and minimal waiting times for economy class travellers, whereas the type of passenger had minimal impact on satisfaction dimensions. @dike2024a analyzed Skytrax feedbacks to explore how customer culture, travel purpose, and seat type shape customer expectations and satisfaction. The study highlighted that customer service quality, delays, and baggage handling significantly impact perceived service performance, with empathy and reliability having the strongest influence on perceived satisfaction, while cultural backgrounds affect levels of customer satisfaction. @chatterjee2023a conducted a ten-year analysis of Skytrax reviews, identifying core attributes such as value for money, seating comfort, and cabin staff behaviour as more strongly related to customer satisfaction and recommendation than augmented aspects like food and beverages and in-flight entertainment. Authors found that core service attributes such as responsiveness and reliability are crucial in shaping customer satisfaction, whereas tangibles and empathy significantly influence customers' likelihood of recommending an airline.\n\nAlso, Skytrax forum have been extensively used to analyze service quality perceptions worldwide. Brochado's [-@brochado2023a] analysis of four leading Chinese airlines highlighted value for money as consistently the most influential service attribute, with varying responses from different traveler types to service attributes. @kwon2021a used the platform to  understand customer needs and preferences in the Asian airline market. @lim2020a used Skytrax feedbacks to compare service quality perceptions between full-service carriers  and low-cost carriers , finding tangibles as the most significant dimension for FSCs and reliability for LCCs. In terms of varied expectations of service quality, @punel2019a revealed that different regions exhibit distinct priorities and expectations concerning in-flight services and overall satisfaction. Passengers in first or business class prioritize seat comfort, food, and beverages, as well as in-flight entertainment. In contrast, passengers in economy class place a higher emphasis on value for money.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\nThis study adopts a Bayesian approach to analyze the score heterogeneity of online consumer reviews (OCRs) across major airline review platforms, specifically TripAdvisor and Skytrax. Our methodological framework is primarily inspired by the work of @martel2023a, who highlighted the importance of managing score heterogeneity between online consumer review websites.\n\n### Data description\n\nThe data for this study was collected from two primary OCR platforms: TripAdvisor and Skytrax. These platforms were chosen due to their popularity and extensive use in academic research on airline services. [Citation needed] The dataset comprises reviews from two distinct airlines: Ryanair, representing the Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs), and Lufthansa, representing the Full-Service Carriers (FSCs). This differentiation allows for a comparative analysis of customer perceptions and expectations across different business models within the airline industry. The reviews span the period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, covering a full year of reviews.\n\n@tbl-descriptive presents various descriptive statistics about the distributions of ratings for Skytrax and TripAdvisor for the two airlines studied. These descriptive statistics provide a detailed overview of the data, highlighting central tendencies, variability, and other relevant aspects of the rating distributions.\n\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/exploratory-analysis.qmd#tbl-descriptive >}}\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::",
