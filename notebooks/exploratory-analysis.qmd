```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)

library(gt)

library(ggplot2)
library(ggtext)
```

Load the data from the RDS file `combined_data.rds`. 

```{r}
airline_data <- read_rds("data/combined_data.rds") |> 
  filter(date >= as.Date("2023-01-01") & date <= as.Date("2023-12-31")) |> 
  mutate(
    score = score*2,
    site = as_factor(site),
    airline = as_factor(airline)
  )
```

Then we will filter by date. From `r format(min(airline_data$date), "%B %Y")` to `r format(max(airline_data$date), "%B %Y")`, one activity's year.


Display the first few rows of the filtered data to check the filtering

```{r}
head(airline_data)
```

# Descriptive analysis 

Generate a summary table showing the mean, standard deviation, and number of reviews for each combination of site and airline.



```{r}
#| label: tbl-descriptive
#| tbl-alt: "Descriptive Statistics of Review Scores by Site (Tripadvisor, Skytrax) and Airline (LCC:Ryanair, FCC:Lufthansa)"
#| tbl-cap: "Descriptive Statistics of Airline Review Scores by Site for the period from 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31"


descriptive_table <- airline_data |>
  group_by(site, airline) |>
  summarize(
    mean_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_score = sd(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_reviews = n(),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

descriptive_table |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(
    title = "Descriptive Statistics of Airline Review Scores by Site",
    subtitle = "For the period from 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31"
  ) |>
  cols_label(
    site = "Site",
    airline = "Airline",
    mean_score = "Mean",
    sd_score = "SD",
    n_reviews = "N"
  ) |>
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Score",
    columns = c(mean_score, sd_score)
  ) |>
  cols_align(
    align = "left",
    columns = vars(airline)
  ) |>
  tab_style(
    style = list(
      cell_text(indent = px(20))
    ),
    locations = cells_body(
      columns = vars(airline)
    )
  ) |>
  tab_style(
    style = cell_borders(
      sides = "bottom",
      color = "black",
      weight = px(2)
    ),
    locations = cells_column_labels(
      columns = everything()
    )
  )

```

Now, we create histograms of review scores by site

```{r}
#| label: fig-histogram
#| fig-cap: "Number of reviews by rating according to website ('Skytrax' and 'Tripadvisor') and airlines (Ryanair and Lufthansa) "


gg  <- ggplot(airline_data, aes(x = score, fill = site)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.7, position = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ site + airline, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Number of reviews by rating according to website (<span style='color:#E41A1C;'>SKYTRAX</span> and<br>
    <span style='color:#377EB8;'>TRIPADVISOR</span>) and airline (RYANAIR and LUFTHANSA),",
       x = "Rating",
       y = "Number of reviews") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_markdown(lineheight = 1.1),
    legend.position = "none"
  )

  gg
